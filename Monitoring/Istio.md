 Istio is an open-source service mesh implementation that manages communication and data sharing between microservices. The platform is added to reduce the complexity of managing network services. Once installed, it injects proxies inside a Kubernetes pod, next to the application container. Each proxy is configured to intercept requests and route traffic to the appropriate service while applying policies.

 Moving from monolithic to microservice architecture, developers get the opportunity to build highly flexible, resilient, and scalable applications within much faster software development life cycles. Although the microservice architecture has many benefits, the evolution in application development also brings certain challenges.
 
 As the architecture consists of many individual services working together, it is important to ensure seamless communication. These autonomous components talk to each other through APIs. However, managing traffic flow and API calls requires a lot of time and effort from the development team.
 
 There was a need for a third-party solution that allowed team members to focus on developing the service logic instead of the network logic. Therefore, service meshes like Istio were designed to manage the network layer of service-to-service communication.

 The main feature of Istio is its role in traffic management. It controls the flow of traffic between services by implementing routing rules through its Envoy proxies. By deploying proxies, Istio directs traffic and API calls without making any changes to the service itself. This allows users to perform canary rollouts, staged rollouts, and A/B testing.

 The platform controls and observes all incoming and outgoing traffic within the network layer. Therefore, it collects large amounts of data that provide useful insight for future development.

 While developers secure the application from potential threats and hacks, Istio authorizes, authenticates, and encrypts all internal communication. Pods and services talk to each other and transfer data under Istio’s policies.
