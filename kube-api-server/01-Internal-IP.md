What is the internal IP assigned to the k8s API server service?

Lets understand.

Kubernetes creates a ClusterIP service called kubernetes in the default namespace.

This service is assigned the first IP address from the Service CIDR range.

It is taken from the ServiceCIDR configuration that defines the range of IP addresses that can be assigned to services within the cluster. It is a configurable value.

Why the first IP?

The first address in this range is a logical choice for the first and most critical service - the API server (I guess)

You can access this IP address via the pod’s default environment variables. For example:

- KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST
- KUBERNETES_PORT_443_TCP_ADDR

These variables provide the IP address and port information of the Kubernetes API server, enabling containers within the cluster to communicate with it.

It is important to note that,

The internal IP address of the API server service may vary if the cluster is configured differently or if a custom service IP range is used.

For example, in managed services like EKS or GKE or in setup where you use custom ServiceCIDR range, it uses the first IP address from that range.
