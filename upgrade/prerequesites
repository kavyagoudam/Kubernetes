# pre-requisites

Here is the go to check list i recommend for your next kubernetes upgrade

1. Backup etcd data - Just in case things go sideways

2. Check the kubernetes version compatibility matrix

3. Disable Swap - Make sure SWAP is off before you begin

4. Drain Nodes - To prepare for the upgrade using 
```command
kubectl drain <node-to-drain> --ignore-daemonsets
```

5. Upgrade Control Plan - Start with API server, etcd and controller manager

6. upgrade kubeadm - update the desired version using below command and then upgrade.
```command
sudo apt-mark unhold kubeadm
```
7. Upgrade kubelet and kubectl - update these after the control plane upgrade

8. Uncordon nodes - Brings the nodes back online once they're upgraded using below command
```command
kubectl uncordon <node-to-uncord>
```

9.  Upgrade Worker Nodes - Do a rolling upgrade of your worker nodes

10. Verify Cluster Status - Double-check that all nodes are ready and running smoothly('kubectl get nodes' should show all nodes as Ready)

11. Monitor etcd upgrade - keep an eye on etcd; stop kube-apiserver temporarily if needed by sedning a SIGTERM signal('killall -s SIGTERM kube-apiserver')

12. Switch Package repository - Move to the new package repository if you haven't already

13. Upgrade CNI plugin

14. Have a Rollback plan - Be ready to recover from a bad state using 'sudo kubeadm upgrade apply --force' if necessary

15. clear Backup Files - which are left in '/etc/kubernetes/tmp' after the upgrade is complete
