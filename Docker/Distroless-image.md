⁉ Distroless Image and its benefits 

Distroless images are a type of container image that contains only the application code and its dependencies, without any unnecessary operating system files or packages. The goal of distroless images is to provide a minimalist and secure container image that reduces the attack surface and improves performance.

✳ Characteristics of distroless images:

1. No OS files: No operating system files, such as shells, utilities, or libraries, are included.
2. Only application code: Only the application code and its dependencies are included.
3. No package managers: No package managers, such as apt or yum, are included.
4. No unnecessary dependencies: Only the necessary dependencies required by the application are included.
5. Small size: Distroless images are typically much smaller than traditional container images.
6. Improved security: By removing unnecessary files and packages, the attack surface is reduced.
7. Faster startup: Distroless images can start faster since there are fewer files to load.


✴ Benefits of distroless images:

1. Improved security: Reduced attack surface and no unnecessary files or packages.
2. Faster performance: Smaller image size and fewer files to load.
3. Simplified maintenance: Fewer components to update and maintain.
4. Better scalability: Smaller images can improve scalability.

📚 Common use cases for distroless images:

1. Serverless functions: Distroless images are well-suited for serverless functions, where only the application code is needed.
2. Microservices: Distroless images can be used for microservices architecture, where each service has a small, focused image.
3. CI/CD pipelines: Distroless images can be used in CI/CD pipelines to build and deploy applications.

🔎 Tools for building distroless images:

1. Google's Distroless: A tool for building distroless images.
2. Docker: Docker can be used to build distroless images using the docker build command.
3. Other tools: Other tools, such as BuildKit and Jib, also support building distroless images.

📰 In summary, distroless images provide a minimalist and secure way to package applications, reducing the attack surface and improving performance. They are well-suited for serverless functions, microservices, and CI/CD pipelines.
