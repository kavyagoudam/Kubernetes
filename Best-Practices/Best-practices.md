Here are the few pointers to ace the microservices game.

1. Optimize your Docker images by using techniques like
-> Multi-stage Docker builds
-> Tools such as Docker slim, and create distress images to ensure lightweight, efficient containers

2. Get familiar with using ingress controllers

3. Use helm for deployments instead of traditional kubernetes manifest files

4. Learn How to observe your infrastructure and applications using tools like dynatrace, datadog

5. Gain experiance in upgrading clusers and related components including add-ons.

6. Master different deployment strategies such as, blue-green deployments, canary deployments.

7. Learn about service discovery and service mesh tools like istio. understand the problems it solves and why it's necessary

8. Get Acquainted with the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and cluster autoscalers like karpenter to scale your EKS and Kubernetes Components.

9. Learn Cost optimization techniques such as
-> Right sizing your worker nodes
-> Setting service quotas
-> Managing CPU and memory allocations in your pods

10. Understand security best practices.

11. Use ArgoCD for gitops to manage your kubernetes applications declaratively.

12. Implement topology spread constraints to ensure high availability and resilience in your application health and ensure smoth operation

13. Deploy your applications using CI/CD tools
14. Understand when and why to use statefulsets in kubernetes for managing stateful applications
15. Leanr to manage multiple envirornments(DEv, UAT, Prod) effectively, considering cost and unique customer use cases

16. Implement kubernetes Cronjobs to take database backups or use recovery tools like velero

17. Avoid creating storage classes at the ArgoCD level to prevent accidentally triggering 'replace' and "force sync" actions

18. Scan Docker images or artifact using tools like jfrog

19. Set up Teams or email alerts for productioon branch to notify if any new code is merged or a build is triggered

20.
