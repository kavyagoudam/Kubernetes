6Ô∏è‚É£ **How do you troubleshoot network issues in a Kubernetes cluster?** 
Use `kubectl exec` to run network diagnostics inside Pods, and check Kubernetes events for network-related issues. Tools like `traceroute`, `ping`, and `nslookup` can help you identify connectivity problems between Pods and services. Network policies and service mesh logs can also provide insights into network traffic flow.

7Ô∏è‚É£ **How do you manage and optimize storage performance in Kubernetes?** 
Choose the right storage class for your workload based on performance requirements (e.g., SSD for high-performance needs). Monitor storage I/O and latency metrics, and ensure that Persistent Volumes are provisioned correctly to avoid bottlenecks. Regularly review and optimize storage configurations for your stateful applications.

8Ô∏è‚É£ **How do you optimize Kubernetes node performance?** 
Ensure that your nodes are properly configured with the right CPU, memory, and storage resources. Use tools like Node Problem Detector to identify node issues early. Additionally, distribute workloads evenly across nodes to avoid overloading any single node, and configure auto-scaling to adjust the number of nodes based on demand.

9Ô∏è‚É£ **What are best practices for handling Kubernetes application scaling?** 
Use Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) for dynamic scaling based on real-time metrics like CPU and memory usage. Implement Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA) to adjust resource requests and limits as needed. Regularly test and optimize your scaling policies to ensure they respond efficiently to changes in demand.

üîü **How do you implement proactive monitoring to prevent performance issues in Kubernetes?** 
Set up proactive monitoring with tools like Prometheus and Grafana to continuously track resource usage, application health, and system metrics. Configure alerts for critical thresholds, such as high CPU or memory usage, and take action before performance issues affect your users.
