1.Pods in CrashLoopBackOff State :- 
• Imagine you deploy an application on Kubernetes, but some of your pods go into a `CrashLoopBackOff` state. How would you troubleshoot and resolve this issue?

2. High Latency in Services :- 
• Let’s say your team is noticing high latency when accessing one of the services in the cluster. What steps would you take to diagnose and mitigate this latency?

3. Failed Deployment Due to Resource Limits :- 
• You’re rolling out a new deployment, but it fails due to resource constraints. How would you approach this situation to ensure the deployment succeeds?

4. Networking Issues Between Pods :- 
• Suppose some pods are unable to communicate with each other within the same namespace. What would be your strategy to identify and fix the networking issue?

5. PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) Not Bound
• You notice that a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is stuck in a `Pending` state and is not getting bound to a PersistentVolume (PV). How would you troubleshoot and resolve this?

 6. Unexpected Node Failures :- 
• Let’s say a node in your Kubernetes cluster suddenly fails, causing disruption to your applications. How would you handle this situation, and what preventive measures would you put in place for the future?"

7. Kubernetes API Server Slowness :- 
• What if the Kubernetes API server is responding slowly or timing out? What steps would you take to diagnose and resolve this issue?"

8. Image Pull Issues :- 
• Imagine you’ve pushed a new image to your container registry, but your Kubernetes pods are failing to pull the image. How would you troubleshoot and fix this problem?

9. Unresponsive Cluster Components :-
• If you find that certain components of your Kubernetes cluster, like the kube-scheduler or kube-controller-manager, are unresponsive or underperforming, how would you approach troubleshooting?

10. HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) Not Scaling :- 
 • Your application is experiencing a high load, but the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) is not scaling up the pods as expected. How would you investigate and resolve this?
